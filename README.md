# CS4550 Final Project
This project is a simple job posting and searching website built in JavaScript using the React library. The client-side application interacts with the [Node server](https://github.com/ty-pacchione/web-dev-project-node) with HTTP using the Axios library. The website is currently being hosted [here](https://users--silly-strudel-932b91.netlify.app/home), and the server is currently running [here](https://web-dev-project-node-users.onrender.com/).
